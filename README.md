# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## How to Play
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game played against the computer in the CLI. You can also use a REPL like [repl.it](https://repl.it). Run the file, then choose the players and how many rounds you want to play in a single match.

The player pool currently consists of the following:
* Human: the user chooses the moves
* Rocker: computer who always chooses rock
* Randomizer: computer who chooses a random move
* Cycler: computer who cycles through rock, then paper, scissors, then back to rock
* Copycat: computer who always copies its opponent's last move

This is a project for the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree. I wrote this to demonstrate my ability to be a code reviewer for the project.

## Code
The game is written in Python 3.7. While a simpler version using fewer classes is possible, the directions are explicit about included classes and methods.

## Process
I used [pycodestyle](https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle) to check adherence to PEP8 guidelines.

Near the end of the project, I started adhering to Udaity's [git style guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).
