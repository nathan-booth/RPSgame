# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This game is played against the computer in the CLI. You can also use a REPL like [repl.it](https://repl.it). It is written in Python 3.

This is a project for the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree. I wrote this to demonstrate my ability to be a code reviewer for the project.
